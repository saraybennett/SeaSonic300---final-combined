This is a collaboration between Sara & Katie for their IMA Low Res Fall 2025 Connections Lab course. It is an extension of the project that they did for their project 02.

SB notes 12.6:

- worked on getting web sockets working, talked with Brian and he said that we need to manually assign users a unique id since that is not being done for us like it was using socket.io, line 58 in index.js is where I tried to work on this but did not succeed
- added button to work on story hover but we can also use button clicks if they are put in the right part of the code which seems to be in the dom content loaded function
